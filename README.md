## Description
To create a GOList users enter a UniProt ID in the given field and click submit. This adds information to a table that acts as our GOList. For each entry the following pieces of information were considered to be most relevent: protein names, gene names, organism, taxonomic lineage, function, and subcellular location. Users can select entries by clicking the row and delete these entries by clicking the "Delete Selected" button. The 'datatables.net' query plugin was chosen for implementation as it allows for column sorting, searching, and row removal. Features to export the data could also be added with additional extensions.

## Setup
npm install
npm start
